# ABOUT WORKSHOP 3 (PANDOC)

## PANDOC 

Pandoc is a command-line tool for converting files from one markup language to another. Markup languages use tags to annotate sections of a document. Commonly used markup languages include Markdown, ReStructuredText, HTML, LaTex, ePub, and Microsoft Word DOCX . Basically it is used to convert a file from on type to other.

## MY EXPERIENCE AT WORKSHOP 

On 19-07-2024 , Friday we embarked on a mission to demystify Pandoc, a versatile document conversion tool, through our third workshop. I was both excited and anxious about how the day would unfold, especially with the technical hiccups we faced right at the start.

## THE TECHNICAL HURDLE

Our first challenge hit us as soon as we tried to set up. We realized we didn’t have the necessary converters for screen 
sharing, which put a wrench in our plans. To make matters worse, the WiFi connection decided to be uncooperative. Despite these setbacks, we managed to push through and start the workshop, determined to make it a success.

## THE PERSENTATION

**Karmandeep Kaur** took the stage first, providing an engaging introduction to Pandoc. She laid a solid foundation, explaining what Pandoc is and its importance in converting documents from one format to another.

**Sharandeep Kaur** walked the audience through the installation process. She ensured that everyone understood how to set up Pandoc on their own systems, making it accessible for everyone to follow along.

Next, **Kamaljeet Kaur**, with the assistance of **Harleen Kaur**, demonstrated the basic conversion of a markdown file to HTML and DOCX. Their hands-on demonstration made the process look straightforward and easy to replicate, boosting the audience’s confidence.

**Akshay Chopra (Me)** then explained the difference between files processed with and without the standalone function. His detailed explanation highlighted the nuances and options available in Pandoc, providing deeper insights into its capabilities.

**Ishmeet singh** explained the process of making an ebook using Pandoc. he aimed to show the practical application of Pandoc in a real-world scenario, emphasizing its utility and versatility.

## AUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT 

One of the most rewarding aspects of the workshop was the audience. They were incredibly attentive and stayed with us until the very end. Many of them participated in hands-on activities, which was encouraging to see. They were keen to learn, asking questions and clearing their doubts, which made the session interactive and lively.

## SUMMARY 

Looking back, despite the initial technical challenges, the workshop was a success. The teamwork and resilience displayed by everyone were commendable. Each member of the team played a crucial role, and the audience’s engagement made all the efforts worth it.
This experience taught me the importance of adaptability and teamwork. It reinforced the value of preparation and the ability to think on one’s feet. Most importantly, it was a reminder that with determination and collaboration, we can overcome any obstacle.
I’m grateful for the opportunity to be a part such a dedicated team and to share knowledge with an enthusiastic audience. This workshop was not just about Pandoc; it was about learning, growing, and moving forward together.
